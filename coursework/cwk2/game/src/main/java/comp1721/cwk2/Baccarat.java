   * 
   * Meaning that the game will not be able to use 8 decks
   * However, there are two ways to let the user specify the number of decks:</p>
   * 
   * <p>1. User specified number of decks in the command line (processing any errors too)
   * 
   *    <code>if (args[1].equals("6") || args[1].equals("8") 
   *            { baccaratShoe = new Shoe(args[1]); }</code>
   * 
   * <p>2. Prompt user for input for the number of the decks in interactive mode
   *    Use hard coded value in default mode</p>
   * 
   * <p>I decided to go with implementation number 2 in which the user
   * chooses the number of decks they would like to play with in interactive mode,
   * since in the default mode, no command line arguments are passed (per coursework specification)
   * and the functionality is essentialy the same.</p>
   * 
   * <p>Therefore in default mode, the shoe contains 6 decks. Of course 
   * this has its own limitations in that in default mode the user cannot play with 8 decks.
   * This option can be disabled by commenting out the <code>while</code> loop</p>
